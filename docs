# General Information 

This Program has to send a big amount of emails to different addresses. This causes the processor to wait even that its next task is data independent from the blocking task. This application tries to solve this problem with a thread pool. 
The thread pool decides how many threads to use, according to the hardware number of cores and then ensures that every thread becomes the new task as soon as the resources are available.

The Program was only tested in Linux but it should work fine for other platform as well 
A makefile is attached to the application to quick, compile and clean

The program is executed:
- make main exe
